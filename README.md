# HLL R Package 

Package of useful functions used in the Hearing & Language Lab, Dept. of Communication Sciences & Disorders, Northwestern University: hll.northwestern.edu

Requires plyr and car packages.

Most functions are used to manipulate raw data output (i.e. .csv files) from PsychoPy. This package does not contain any data or personal information from the Hearing & Language Lab. 

The functions in this package were developed by researchers of the Hearing & Language Lab and are intended for HLL personnel and projects. Therefore, not all features are generalizable to different projects and dataframes that are outside of its intended use. 

Feedback for this package is welcome.
